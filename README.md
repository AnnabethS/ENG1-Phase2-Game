# ENG1-Pirate-Game

## Description

You are a privateer with allegiance to one College at the University of York. You sail the great Lake of
York on quests and adventures, and may choose to attack ships of other Colleges, try to sack
Colleges, etc. Gameplay ends when the player is defeated in some way (e.g., in combat with
another privateer, or destroyed by a rival College), or when the player has achieved the gameâ€™s
objective.
